# chempy

This repository contains Python notebooks from the Chemical Engineering Department at the University of Utah. The purpose of these notebooks is to:

1. **aid** in the transition of our department to using Python
2. **teach** students the principles of programming using Python
3. **educate** students in the art of computing and data analysis using Python

There are currently two notebooks in this repository:

## [EasyPy](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/format/slides/github/saadtony/chempy/blob/master/easypy.ipynb#)
Contains an easy introduction to python (click to access slideshow).
